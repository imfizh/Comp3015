How does the user interact with your executable? How do you open and control the
software you wrote (exe file)?
• How does the program code work? How do the classes and functions fit together and who
does what? 
• What makes your shader program special and how does it compare to similar things?
(Where did you get the idea from? What did you start with? How did you make yours
unique? Did you start with a given shader/project?)
• Include a link to a video report that details the above but also goes into more detail on:
 o Anything else which will helps us understand how your shader works.
 o Are there any software engineering issues, such as the trade-off between
 performance and good practice?
 o A (brief) evaluation of what you think you have achieved, and what (if anything) you
 would do differently, knowing what you now know. Don’t be modest but be realistic!
